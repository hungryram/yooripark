Located south of famed Ventura Blvd, this architectural masterpiece has been thoughtfully updated throughout to offer the latest in modern luxury. Once inside, gleaming Brazilian hardwood floors open to volume & natural light pouring in through walls of glass that open to a veranda with the romance & drama of scenic canyon and greenbelt views. The blended dining & living room w/fireplace compliment a gorgeous chef's kitchen with custom cabinets, stone counters & high-end stainless appliances. The 1st floor is rounded out by a bedroom + custom bath. Downstairs, a family/TV room w/patio balcony is flanked by 3 additional bedrooms + 3 updated baths, including a sumptuous master suite w/dual vanity bath, soaking tub + walk-in shower. An additional level w/electronic fingerprint access, currently being used as a full professional recording studio, can be converted into a 5th bedroom or office or kept as the amazing studio it is. Dual zone HVAC, and 2-car direct access garage.
