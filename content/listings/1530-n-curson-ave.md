This classic California Craftsman in the Sunset Square HPOZ will steal your heart. Filled with natural light, the home perfectly balances modern updates & original 1913 elements. With Brazilian walnut floors throughout, the home flows beautifully from the living & dining rooms to the kitchen / family room. Added in 2017, the kitchen is a dream with custom cabinetry, Viking stove, quartz counters & farmhouse sink. The intimate family room opens out onto the deck for a meal al fresco. The master is a true retreat with dual walk-in closets & spectacular en-suite bath (massive steam shower & double sinks). Two other generously sized bedrooms & large bath complete the main house. Added bonuses: a 160 sq ft usable basement as well as a bright sunroom with vaulted ceiling (perfect office). The private and spacious yard offers room for a pool. Host guests in the cozy and guest house with full bath & private patio. Close to Runyon Canyon hiking trails & is central to WEHO & the Sunset Strip.
