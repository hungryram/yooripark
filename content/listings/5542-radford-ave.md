Located is a desirable pocket of Valley Village, this 1940's traditional has endless potential. Filled with light, original charm and hardwood floors throughout, this home has an ideal floor plan. Enter into the formal living room with coved ceilings and fireplace that flows beautifully into the dining room. The bright and cheerful kitchen, with access to the laundry room and backyard, has stainless steel appliances. The kitchen is open to a bonus area that could be used as an office, play room or family room. Set apart from the other two bedrooms, the master has French doors to the yard, ample closets and an en-suite bath. The large, private backyard with patio and new fencing is just waiting for a pool. Separate garage for storage (or possible ADU) is set back on the ample lot. Located near the LA Orange Line & Metro station allows easy access to downtown & the west end of the San Fernando Valley. Close to Valley Village Park, shopping, restaurants & the NoHo Art's District.
