Perched South of famed Ventura Blvd on a street to street lot in prime Studio City, w dazzling treetop, Valley & mountain views, sits this gated Mid-Century home boasting updates inside & out. Once beyond the gated entry, a 2-car garage & carport lead via an elevated walkway to a double entry. Rich wood floors dance across a blended dining & living room, as impossibly high ceilings & walls of glass infuse the space with light & volume. Just beyond, scenic views abound from a sweeping veranda - perfect for entertaining & dining al fresco. The chef's kitchen features newer cabinetry, stone counter tops & high-end appliances. A master suite, w dual vanity bath & walk-in shower, opens to the deck & awe-inspiring views. Below, 3 bedroom + 2 baths are centered around a TV Room w/ direct access to a patio w/ tiered gardens & meandering paths. Central dual HVAC (upstairs and downstairs) adds a touch of luxury, whilst proximity to shops & fine eateries along Ventura Blvd make this a must see!
